## 💻 About Me

I'm a passionate developer focused on building scalable backend systems, modern APIs, and dynamic content architectures. Over the years, I've worked on a wide range of projects from revamping legacy PHP codebases into modern Laravel applications, to building fully dynamic content engines with database-driven templates and workflows.

I love working with:

- ⚙️ **Laravel** (Core expertise)
- 🐘 **PHP** (Advanced)
- 🔁 **Redis** | ☁️ **Amazon S3**
- 🟦 **MySQL**
- 🌐 **Node.js** with **Sequelize** and **TypeScript**
- 🧠 Smart content systems with variable-driven rendering and conditional logic
